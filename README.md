# 🎓 Campus Navigation System

A graph-based campus navigation system developed in C++ and Python that computes optimal routes between university locations.

 🚀 Features
- Represents campus locations as nodes and pathways as edges
- Uses adjacency lists for structured route storage
- Implements graph traversal algorithms to compute optimal paths
- Interactive console interface for source and destination input
- Displays total transitions/steps required

🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Python
- Graph Data Structures
- Algorithm Design

📚 Concepts Applied
- Graph Theory
- Adjacency Lists
- Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)
- Structured Programming

🎯 Objective
To simulate real-world campus route mapping using graph-based logic and algorithmic path computation.
